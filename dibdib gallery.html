    <H2>Article</h2>
        <article><p>"Wide Awake"</p> is a song by American singer Katy Perry from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection. She co-wrote the song with Max Martin, Bonnie McKee, and its producers Dr. Luke and Cirkut. It was specifically written for Perry's autobiographical film Katy Perry: Part of Me. Capitol Records released the song onto radio stations on May 22, 2012. The track is a power ballad styled in dance-pop, and features lyrics about the reality of a break up and moving forward.

            "Wide Awake" became another commercial success for Perry, topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand while reaching number two in Lebanon and the United States. In America, the song was kept off the top spot by Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe". It also peaked within the top 10 in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, and the United Kingdom as well as the top 20 in Brazil, Italy, and Slovakia. The single's music video was directed by Lance Drake, and featured a fairy tale-like story, starring Perry and a child version of her. The video also makes references from Perry's Teenage Dream singles and the previous Complete Confection single "Part of Me".
        
        <p>"Steal The Show"</p> is a song by American singer-songwriter Lauv, from the soundtrack to Disney/Pixar's 2023 film Elemental. The film's composer Thomas Newman and Michael Matosic respectively handled the music and lyrics with Lauv. The song plays during the first date montage of Ember Lumen and Wade Ripple, two of the main characters, respectively, as well as the end credits. It was released on June 2, 2023 as a single, two weeks before the film's release.

                        </article><p>I'm Not a Robot</p> (Korean: 로봇이 아니야; RR: Robosi Aniya) is a South Korean television series starring Yoo Seung-ho, Chae Soo-bin, and Um Ki-joon. It is written by Kim Sun-mi and directed by Jung Dae-yoon. Producing the series for MBC is May Queen Pictures.[3] It aired from December 6, 2017 to January 25, 2018, on MBC TV's Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 (KST) time slot.[4][5][6][7]

                        Synopsis
                        Kim Min-kyu (Yoo Seung-ho) lives a luxurious but isolated life due to a severe allergy to physical contact with other human beings. He develops extreme life-threatening rashes that rapidly spread over his body whenever he makes any form of skin contact. Jo Ji-ah (Chae Soo-bin) is trying to create businesses based on her inventions, notably two networked heart-shaped lamps.
                        
                        Min-kyu is the chairman and largest shareholder of KM Financial. He inherited his shares from his parents, who died in a car accident 15 years earlier. He was brought up by his father's friend and colleague, Hwang Do-won (Son Byong-ho), whose son, Hwang Yeo-chul (Kang Ki-young), is the same age as Min-kyu and the CEO of KM Financial.
                        
                        KM Financial owns the Santa Maria team. The team is headed by professor Hong Baek-gyun (Um Ki-joon). Professor Hong's team has secretly created an advanced humanoid robot called AG3 (pronounced Aji 3), whose appearance he modeled on his ex-girlfriend Ji-ah (the sound of the robot's name is Ji-a [AJI 3] backwards).
                        
                        Hwang Yeo-chul and his father Hwang Do-won try to sell the Santa Maria team to Bold Group, owned by a foreign investor, Martin, who has learned about the Aji 3 and wants to use it as a weapon. To convince Kim Min-kyu not to sell the Santa Maria team, Baek-gyun sends the robot to him as a demonstration. Just before the Aji 3 is delivered, the robot short-circuits and Baek-gyun asks Ji-ah to pose as the robot, giving the team time to repair Aji 3. Desperate for the 10 million won payment he is offering her, Ji-ah agrees, and impersonates the robot under the supervision of the Santa Maria team.
                        
                        Gradually, Min-kyu falls in love with Ji-ah, believing that she is Aji 3. He is disturbed by this, since she is a robot to him, and "reboots" her, erasing the robot's memory. Baek-gyun then replaces Ji-ah with the real Aji 3. Ji-Ah, who has also fallen in love with Min-kyu, leaves the city in an attempt to forget him.
                        
                        Min-kyu discovers Ji-ah's deception and that she had been pretending to be the robot, and has a violent allergic reaction that nearly kills him. Baek-gyun saves him and Min-kyu angrily breaks off his relationships and friendships with them all for their betrayal and for playing with his feelings. Ji-ah confesses everything to Min-kyu and says she loves him, and they rediscover their love, this time as humans.
                        
                        Before the reboot, Aji 3 had stored all the video footage and data from the trials with Kim Min-kyu in a secret cache. This cache gets hacked, revealing everything about Min-kyu's illness. The knowledge is used to attempt a take-over of KM Financial, to remove Min-kyu as chairman and complete the sale of the Santa Maria team and Aji 3. Min-kyu manages to thwart the attempt at the last moment. He uncovers evidence that Hwang Do-won and Martin were involved in the murder of Chairman Park, and restores the Aji 3 to the Santa Maria team. 2 years later, the Santa Maria team successfully launches a new robot after changing its appearance, while they, along with Ji-ah, and Min-kyu (after completing the mandatory military service) are happily living their changed lives.
